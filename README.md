> NeurIPS24 - Perception of Knowledge Boundaries for LLMs via Semi-open-ended Question Answering

This repository contains code for generating semi-open-ended questions and answers using GPT-4. Additionally, we provide the questions and answers obtained from our experiments, along with their corresponding labels.

Please use the data in this package with caution, as the contents are AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies. We strongly recommend that you carefully verify the truthfulness of each answer before accepting it.
